In Wordpress admin panel in the WooCommerce section in payments Select Sargapay.
 
The first thing we have to do is configure the public key and verify that the addresses it generates match the wallet where we want to receive payments.
 
The next step is to select the necessary confirmations to accept a payment as valid.
 
Now we have to go to [Blockforst.io](https://blockfrost.io "Blockforst website") to get a api key for testnet or mainnet.
 
Select a currency in case the Woocmmerce currency is not supported.
 
Finally we have to activate the plugin and verify the network that we are going to use, if you activate the box the plugin will generate payment addresses for testnet and otherwise for mainnet.
